// -------------Encapsulation-------------
// Encapsulation is another fundamental concept of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). 
// It refers to the idea of bundling the data (variables) and the methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit (class), and restricting direct access to some of the object's components.
//  This helps in protecting the internal state of the object from unintended or harmful modifications and ensures that the object maintains its integrity.
